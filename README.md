**What I'm Focused On:**
- 🧮 **Pure & Applied Mathematics:** Exploring the elegance of theoretical concepts and applying them to solve real-world problems.
- 📈 **Data Visualization Minor:** Combining the precision of data with the power of visual storytelling to make complex information accessible and actionable.
- 🔍 **Optimization & Modeling:** Seeking the sweet spot in every challenge, using advanced optimization techniques to streamline processes and enhance decision-making.
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning Guru:** Believing that good analysis starts with clean data, I’ve honed my skills to transform raw data into a pristine format ready for insight extraction.

**Currently Learning:**
- 🐍 Python for advanced data analysis and machine learning.
- 📊 R for statistical analysis and beautiful data visualizations.
- 🔎 Machine Learning models to predict and prescribe actions based on data.

**Looking to Collaborate On:**
- 📚 Academic projects that push the boundaries of our understanding in data science.
- 💼 Internships where I can apply my skills and grow in a practical setting.
- 🌐 Open Source projects that benefit from data analysis and visualization.

**When I’m not number-crunching:**
- I’m brushing up on the latest data science literature.
- I’m visualizing my next adventure with friends and family.
- I’m exploring the interplay between AI and human creativity.

Let's connect and explore the fascinating world of data together!
